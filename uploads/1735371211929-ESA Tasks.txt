For PO Inbound shipment invoice we need to remove Shipment documents in SCH manually as it is deleted in SAP, for shipment documents there is no deletion indicator in SAP so it is not captured in SAP to SCH Delta loads. Kindly approve to remove in SCH DB. 
 
We will check in SAP Log tables whether it is possible to identify deleted shipment documents as they don't reflect in actual Shipment tables.
